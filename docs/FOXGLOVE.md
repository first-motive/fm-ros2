# Foxglove

The dev container runs `foxglove_bridge`; Foxglove Studio on the host connects at
`ws://localhost:8765`. Plain `docker compose ... up` opens a shell, not the bridge —
use the helper to serve the port:

```bash
./scripts/foxglove.sh           # shared stack (default)
./scripts/foxglove.sh -t        # throwaway container, auto-cleans on exit
./scripts/foxglove.sh -p 9000   # custom in-container bridge port
```

| Mode | Command | Container | ROS graph |
|------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| shared (default) | `up -d` + `exec` | long-lived | shared with sim / other `exec` sessions |
| throwaway (`-t`) | `run --rm` | fresh, auto-clean | isolated |

Shared keeps one container, so the bridge sees topics from sim and other `exec`
sessions with no extra DDS config. Tear it down with
`docker compose -f docker/compose.yaml -f docker/compose.macos.yaml down`. Throwaway
runs an isolated bridge that cleans up on exit.

To view a robot URDF in Foxglove, run `./scripts/view-robot.sh` (default G1-D;
`--robot so101` or `--robot openarm` for the others) — it starts
robot_state_publisher plus the bridge with meshes. See
[fm_description/README.md](../fm_description/README.md#view-robots) for the
robot table, variants, and caveats.
